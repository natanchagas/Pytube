# Pytube

Hello! This project was created in order to work on my Flask skills. Instead of doing some random page, I decided to focus my effort on something that I thought would be useful, **downloading youtube videos**.

The name Pytube came from the library used to download the videos, Pytube. Go and check it for yourself: [pytube.io](https://pytube.io/en/latest/)

## Development environment

- Ubuntu 21.04
- Python 3.9
- Flask (And some related libraries)
- Pytube
- ffmpeg
- ffmpeg-python

## Next Steps

Even though the mais objective was achieved, there're still somethings that can be improved:

### Front end

- Fix footer at the end of the page on higher resolutions
- Make sure it's working on multiple browsers - Only Firefox at the moment
- Forms format
- Video List page

### Back end

- Organize in modules to add more features
- Fix URL format
- Simplify and reduce pytube requests
- Video List page
